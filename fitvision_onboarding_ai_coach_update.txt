### Date: October 31, 2025
### Author: Product Team – FitVision

## 1. Overview & Goal

The goal of this update is to streamline the new user onboarding experience and simplify the main app navigation. This update aims to:

- Present the onboarding interview only once to new users, immediately after account creation.
- Remove redundant or outdated menu items.
- Introduce persistent and clear access to the AI health coach via the main navigation menu.

This improves the clarity, focus, and efficiency of the user experience.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### Feature A: One-Time Onboarding Flow

**Description:**
The current multi-step onboarding interview will now only be shown once, immediately after account creation for new users. This eliminates redundancy and enhances user flow.

**Requirements:**
- Onboarding interview is triggered only once post sign-up.
- Upon completion, users are routed directly to their main dashboard (first-day experience).
- The onboarding flow should never appear again after initial completion.
- Existing users logging in after the update will not see the onboarding flow.
- Remove "Onboarding Interview" access from all other parts of the app UI.

**Persistence Logic:**
- Use a flag in user profile metadata to indicate if onboarding is complete (`onboardingComplete: true/false`).
- Check this flag at login. If `false`, show onboarding. If `true`, go to dashboard.

### Feature B: Main Navigation Menu Update

**Description:**
Update the main navigation menu by removing the "Onboarding" item and replacing it with a new item for direct access to the AI health coach.

**Requirements:**
- Permanently remove "Onboarding Interview" from navigation.
- Add a new persistent menu item labeled:
  - **Label:** "AI Coach" (alt: "Chat with Coach")
  - **Icon Suggestion:** Chat bubble with sparkle or AI spark icon (symbolizing intelligence + conversation)
- Tapping "AI Coach" opens the chat interface with the AI health and wellness coach.
- This feature must be available to all users at all times.

**Menu Placement:**
- The new "AI Coach" item should occupy the same position previously held by "Onboarding Interview," or be prominently placed for high visibility.
