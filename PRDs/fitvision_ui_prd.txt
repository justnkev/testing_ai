**Product Requirements Document (PRD)**

**Project Title:** FitVision – Minimalist UI Redesign (Inspired by Oura)

**Owner:** Product Management
**Stakeholders:** Design, Engineering, AI Team
**Status:** Draft
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-30

---

## 1. Objective
Redesign the UI of the FitVision health & wellness app to reflect a minimalist, Oura-inspired visual identity. The update should improve user focus, introduce calming and grounded design elements, and support cumulative wellness tracking across core areas: activity, meals, calories, sleep, and habit formation.

---

## 2. Guiding Design Principles
- **Minimalist Aesthetic**: Inspired by Oura app
- **Dark Mode Default**: Soft black backgrounds with low-light optimized contrast
- **Purple-Centric Palette**: Varying shades of purple for primary buttons, indicators, and accents
- **Airy Typography**: Large, spacious fonts for clarity and calm
- **Tone**: Balanced and grounded — supportive, neutral, and motivational without intensity
- **Microinteractions**: Smooth, subtle transitions (no bounce or jitter)

## 5. Functionality Scope
- All UI screens defined above

- `/dashboard` may use backend aggregations or calculated summaries

---

## 6. Exclusions / Future Enhancements
- No editable user profile interface yet
- No third-party integrations (e.g. wearables)
- Dashboard is MVP: may be expanded to include trends or AI tips in v2

---

## 7. Dependencies
- `ai_service` (onboarding, plan, visualization)
- `storage_service` (user data, logs, visualizations)
- Flask routes and templates (as per uploaded files)

---

## 8. Success Criteria
- All redesigned pages render properly with dark theme and purple accents
- Users can complete onboarding, generate plan, log progress, and view dashboard
- Dashboard reflects up-to-date cumulative stats
